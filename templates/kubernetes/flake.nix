  description = "mvm microVM — single-node Kubernetes (k3s, rootless)";

  # EXPERIMENTAL scaffold: the image builds, but rootless k3s bring-up and its
  # boot-image capability contract are tracked by this repository's issue #1.
  # See README.md in this directory for the constraints and open items.
  #
  # The template deliberately does not select a boot kernel. `mkGuest`'s
  # `kernel` argument only supplies modules to the rootfs; the host boots the
  # workload kernel from its generated image set. Kubernetes-specific image
  # work and kernel variants do not belong outside this template repository.

      # Networking contract of the guest (see README.md): there is no guest
      # NIC and no TAP/TUN. PID 1 exports ALL_PROXY / HTTP_PROXY /
      # HTTPS_PROXY pointing at the vsock egress proxy on loopback
      # (socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080), and only admitted host:port flows tunnel
      # to the host. Cluster-internal traffic (apiserver, pods, services) is
      # ordinary in-guest netns/bridge traffic and needs no NIC. RootlessKit
      # therefore runs with --net=host: there is no upstream interface for a
      # slirp4netns-style userspace stack to speak to.
